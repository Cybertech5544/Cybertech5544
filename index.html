    <section>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This circuit functions as a mobile phone signal detector. It can sense the presence of an active mobile phone within a radius of three to four meters, triggering an LED (or optionally, a buzzer) to indicate detection.<br>
            This makes it particularly useful for environments like examination halls or meeting rooms where mobile phone use is prohibited.</p>

        <h3>Components</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="list" >555 Timer IC (IC1, IC2)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>IC1 and IC2 are configured as astable multivibrators.</li>
                <li>These ICs produce continuous pulse trains at specific frequencies, which are essential for jamming mobile phone signals.</li>
                <li>The frequencies generated need to cover the mobile phone frequency bands (generally 800-900 MHz and 1800-1900 MHz).</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>They form timing networks with capacitors (C1, C2, C3, C4) to determine the frequency of the oscillation generated by the 555 timers.</li>
                <li>R1 and R2 are part of the timing circuit for IC1, while R3 and R4 are for IC2.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Capacitors (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>C1 and C2: Work with R1 and R2 to set the frequency of the oscillation for IC1.</li>
                <li>C3 and C4: Work with R3 and R4 to set the frequency of the oscillation for IC2.</li>
                <li>C5: Acts as a bypass capacitor, filtering out any noise and stabilizing the power supply to ensure smooth operation.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Inductors (L1, L2)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>L1 and L2 form part of an LC circuit with the capacitors, which determines the resonant frequency.</li>
                <li>They help to ensure that the jamming signal is within the mobile phone frequency bands.</li>
                <li>They also help in impedance matching to ensure efficient transmission of the jamming signal through the antenna.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Variable Resistor (VR1)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>VR1 is used to fine-tune the frequency generated by the 555 timer circuits.</li>
                <li>By adjusting VR1, the user can change the resistance, thus altering the frequency of the square wave output from the 555 timers to better match the target mobile phone frequency bands.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Antenna (ANT1)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The antenna broadcasts the generated jamming signal into the air.</li>
                <li>It ensures that the jamming signal can propagate through space and interfere with mobile phone communications.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Transistors (Q1, Q2)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Q1 and Q2 receive the oscillating signal from the 555 timers and amplify it.</li>
                <li>The amplified signal is necessary to ensure that the jamming signal is strong enough to disrupt mobile phone communications within the desired range.</li>
                <li>They effectively increase the power of the signal before it is transmitted by the antenna.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="list" >Power Supply</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The circuit requires a stable DC power supply to function correctly.</li>
                <li>The power supply could be a battery or an external DC source, ensuring the 555 timers, transistors, and other components have sufficient power to operate.</li>
            </ul>
